<h1>Hey there! I'm Marilee Jean.</h1>
<p>I'm a student at Oakton College near Chicago. Currently pursuing an Associate degree in computer science and would like to get into IT as a career when I graduate. I' ha've earned a Google IT Support Certification and a Basic Vocational Certificate in Web Design. I'm currently working part time at Office Max and will be looking for full time work when I graduate in May 2023.</p>
<p>I'm interested in coding in general, enjoy data in columns in rows, and love to tinker with hardware and electronics. On my down time, you can find me enjoying the outdoors in a hammock, tie-dyeing t-shirts, or snuggling with my cockatiel.</p>
